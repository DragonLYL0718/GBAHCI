# About the Symposium
 
This symposium aims to provide a stage for HCI researchers based in Greater Bay Area of China to share their work that are in work-in-progress, to be published or have been pulbished at latest or upcoming HCI venues (such as ACM CHI, USIT, CSCW, Ubicomp, etc.). This event is a one-day, on-site exclusive experience without options for virtual participation, and no proceedings will be published. We also welcome the participants from outside the Great Bay Area if the condition allows you. This symposium is rather an informal event, and organized on a low budget with limited human resources. A DIY (Do-It-Yourself) spirit is encouraged for all preparations and logistics not directly related to the event, such as traveling, accommodation, and printing (thanks for your understanding).

Three options are open for registration: “**presenter of (to be) published work**”, “**participant of the poster session**” and “**attendee of the symposium**”. As the “presenter of (to be) published work”, it is required that your work has been published or accepted in the HCI conferences in 2023-2024. For the poster session, the participants can share their work-in-progress by means of printed posters. We encourage participants in the poster session to handle the printing and transportation of their posters independently. Please check the link (<font color=Red>****</font>) for the template and simple guidance for how to make the poster. No registration fee is required. 

If you are interested, please register no later than <font color=Red>***</font> which will give us sufficient time to prepare for the event.

本次研讨会旨在为粤港澳大湾区的HCI（人机交互）研究者提供一个交流平台，用于分享他们正在进行中、即将发表或已在近期HCI领域的相关会议（如ACM CHI, USIT, CSCW, Ubicomp等）上发表的工作。本次活动是一个为期一天的线下交流活动，不提供虚拟参与选项，也不会发布会议论文集。如果条件允许，我们也欢迎来自大湾区以外的参与者。因本次活动预算与人力资源有限，我们鼓励所有参与者自行解决与本次活动无直接关联的准备和后勤工作，如旅行、住宿和打印（感谢您的理解）。

本次活动提供三种注册选项：“**即将/已发表作品的报告人**”、“**海报环节参与者**”和“**研讨会听众**”。作为“即将/已发表作品的报告人”，您的工作必须已在2023-2024年的HCI会议上发表或被接受。海报环节允许参与者通过打印海报的形式分享他们正在进行的工作（我们鼓励海报环节的参与者自行负责海报的打印和运输）。请访问链接（<font color=Red>****</font>）查看海报模板和制作指南。参与本次活动无需注册费。

如果您感兴趣，请务必在<font color=Red>***</font>之前注册，以便我们有足够的时间进行活动准备。
